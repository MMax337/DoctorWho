## Running the Simulation

To run the simulation, use `run.py`. Two options are available:

1. **Printing Options:**
   - Choose between `--printing` and `--no-printing`.
   - `--printing` is the default and will print the game history.

2. **Executive File:**
   - The file `main` will be created.

3. **Providing Arguments:**
   - Two options are available:
     - **Option 1: List of Filenames**
       - Provide a list of filenames. Each simulation will run once.
       - Example: 
         ```bash
         ./main.exe game1.txt game2.txt game3.txt
         ```
       - Note: Statistics are not available for this regime.
     - **Option 2: Filename and Integer**
       - Provide one filename and an integer.
       - Example: 
         ```bash
         ./main game1.txt 5
         ```
       - This will run the simulation using `game1.txt` five times and print the statistics.

**Additional Information:**

- Three sample boards are provided (`game1.txt`, `game2.txt`, `game3.txt`).
- Adjust endline characters in the provided boards for cross-platform compatibility.

**Project Documentation:**

- Explore the UML folder for the UML diagram detailing the project structure.

## Simple Performance Test

(run on @students account)
1. **With Printing Option Enabled (1,000 Iterations):**
   - The total time taken for processing "game3.txt" 100 times, with the printing option enabled, was **1,013,980 microseconds**.
   - (8,891,681 lines of text)

2. **Without Printing Option (100,000 Iterations):**
   - Disabling the printing option and processing "game3.txt" 100,000 times took **3,677,534 microseconds**.
